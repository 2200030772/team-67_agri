  <h1>water management in agriculture</h1>  
  <p>Affordable and efficient methods in water management will be key to production of food and economic security for sustained livelihoods in both irrigated and rain-fed scenarios.</p>
  <h2>drip irrigation</h2>
  <p>It delivers water and nutrients directly to the plant's roots zone, in the right amounts, at the right time, so each plant gets exactly what it needs, when it needs it, to grow optimally.</p>
  <h3>irrigation scheduling</h3>
  <p>Its purpose is to maximize irrigation efficiencies by applying the exact. amount of water needed to replenish the soil moisture to the desired level.</p>
  <h4>dry farming</h4>
  <p>the cultivation of crops without irrigation in regions of limited moisture, typically less than 20 inches (50 centimetres) of precipitation annually</p>
  <h5>mulch</h5>
  <p>mulch is a material spread on top of the soil to conserve moistureMulch made from organic materials such as straw or wood chips will break down into compost, further increasing the soilâ€™s ability to retain water </p>
