<h1>What Are Fertilizers?</h1>
<p>Fertilizers are food for plants they provide nutrients for plants to grow and thrive.</p>
<h2>Types of Fertilizers</h2>
<p>Plant nutrients can be provided by mineral, organic or organo-mineral fertilizers, as well as through natural processes such as biological nitrogen fixation or the weathering of soil minerals.</p>
<h3>Production</h3>
<p>The production of synthetic, or inorganic, fertilizers requires prepared chemicals, whereas organic fertilizers are derived from the organic processes of plants and animals in biological processes using biochemicals.</p>
<h4>Application</h4>
<p>Fertilizers are commonly used for growing all crops, with application rates depending on the soil fertility, usually as measured by a soil test and according to the particular crop. Legumes, for example, fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and generally do not require nitrogen fertilizer.</p>
